# Text Recognition from Images

## Context
This project aims to extract text from images using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) techniques with pytesseract.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV for image preprocessing
- Pytesseract for Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
- Pandas for data manipulation

## Technical skills
- **Text Extraction:** Use of Pytesseract to extract text from preprocessed images.
- **Data Cleaning:** Removal of unwanted characters and normalization of the text.
- **Use of RegEx**
- **Object Oriented Programming**

## Challenge
- Different test formats
- Some variability from one image to another
- Sometimes data was incorrectly saved in source files

## Skills Developed
- Machine Learning: Utilization of OCR models for text extraction.
- Data Manipulation: Skill in cleaning and transforming textual data.
- Data Analysis: Ability to perform exploratory analysis and draw insights from complex data.
